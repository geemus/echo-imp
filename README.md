# Herocho
(Her)oku + E(cho)

# (Rough) How To

1. setup skill on AWS developer console, use data from interaction_model
2. deploy to heroku
3. set CREDENTIALS with `user:pass` of some sort (you'll need to include this in your skill URL like `https://user:pass@app-name.herokuapp.com`)
4. set ECHO_APPLICATION_ID from AWS developer console for verifying request source
5. say `echo tell {skill-name} to say hello`
6. ponder what awesome stuff you could build with voice integration
